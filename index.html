        <p><em>Update: Research Scientist at Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Moscow. PhD candidate at ITMO University. See more <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EXAMPLE">here</a>.</em></p>
        
        <p><strong>Advancing artificial intelligence through optimal transport and reinforcement learning.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Building safe and effective AI systems is the most important technical problem of our time.</p>
        
        <p>I am a Research Scientist at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute in Moscow, where I develop cutting-edge methods in optimal transport theory, reinforcement learning, and generative modeling. My work bridges theoretical machine learning advances with real-world applications, particularly in drug discovery and domain adaptation.</p>
        
        <p>Currently pursuing my PhD at ITMO University, I also serve as a Lecturer at MIPT University, where I lead comprehensive courses on generative modeling for graduate students.</p>
        
        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Theoretical Breakthroughs:</strong> Pioneered neural optimal transport methods with general costs, published in top-tier venues including NeurIPS and ICLR. My work on "Neural Optimal Transport with General Costs" has advanced the field's understanding of optimal transport in machine learning applications.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Drug Discovery Impact:</strong> At Insilico Medicine, I developed AI algorithms that generated molecules showing favorable pharmacokinetics in mice trials. Built Python frameworks for fast molecule generation and scoring using deep neural networks, demonstrating real-world impact of AI in pharmaceutical research.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Research Leadership:</strong> As Head of reinforcement learning research at ITMO University ML Lab, I have advanced agent stabilization methods and developed new approaches for offline reinforcement learning using optimal transport theory.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Educational Excellence:</strong> Designed and delivered 60+ hours of lectures on deep generative models, from GANs to diffusion models, for master's students. My teaching bridges theoretical foundations with practical implementations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Recognition:</strong> My work has been recognized with the Ilya Segalovich Award by Yandex (less than 1% acceptance rate) and the Huawei Prize for machine learning researchers. With 10+ publications in top-tier conferences, I continue to push the boundaries of AI research.</p>
        
        <p>I approach research with a focus on both theoretical rigor and practical impact, believing that the most important advances come from solving real-world problems through revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs.</p>
        
        <p>My research spans optimal transport theory, reinforcement learning, and generative models, with applications in drug discovery, domain adaptation, and AI safety. I am particularly interested in developing methods that can scale safely and effectively.</p>
        
        <p>If you're interested in collaboration or discussing cutting-edge AI research, I'd love to connect.</p>
        
        <p>Now is the time to advance AI safely and effectively.</p>
